# Just Write
## Simple Android text editor

(Signed .apk)[app-release.apk]

At first, Just Wrtie was a personal foray into app development and building for users. However, I have since deprecated the listing in the Google Play Store since I became unable to support it in a timely manner. Instead, I decided to clean up the code a bit (in progress) and make it a public reference. I'm not sure exactly what that means yet, but this README is the first step in that direction.
